Hello Together,

this is my first input programm for an embedded system that adds a PID Control for a coffee maschine. 

In addition, the grinder will measure the weight of the coffee. In the current state, a timer can be set to adjust the amount of coffee which is not really accurate.

The entire PID can be adjust by phone.

This setup is still in devolopment.
